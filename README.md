# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

👋 Hi, I'm Federico, a computer science student with a strong inclination towards problem-solving and cybersecurity. Currently, I work as a full stack developer, specializing in building robust and scalable web applications. I love exploring new technologies and constantly improving my skills.

🔍 In my free time, I enjoy participating in CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions, where I can test and hone my cybersecurity skills.

📚 I'm always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities. If you share my interests or have any interesting projects, feel free to reach out!
